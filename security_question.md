# Infrastructure Security - OWASP Top 10 Guide

## 1. Access Control

- Role-based access control (RBAC) to clearly differentiate levels of access.
- Regular audits of access logs to detect any unusual or unauthorized activity.

## 2. Cryptographic Failures

- Use HTTPS across our web interface and API connections.
- Passwords are stored securely using advanced hashing techniques.

## 3. Injection

- Validate all user input to prevent SQL injections.
- Use parameterized queries in our MySQL database.
- Regularly review the code for injection security.

## 4. Insecure Design

- Encourage secure development practices among the team.
- Conduct routine security risk assessments.

## 5. Misconfiguration

- Configure Kubernetes following best security practices.
- Keep our systems up to date with the latest security patches.
- Change all default configurations during our initial deployment phase.

## 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

- Monitor and update our application dependencies to avoid vulnerabilities.
- Use automated tools for the management and notification of known vulnerabilities.

## 7. Identification and Authentication Failures

- Implement multi-factor authentication on all accessible systems.
- Protect against brute force attacks with login attempt policies and account lockout.

## 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures

- Ensure code integrity with digital signatures.
- Establish strong data backup and restoration policies.

## 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

- Logging and monitoring designed to detect and notify of suspicious activities immediately.

## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

- Validate all URLs and restrict backend network access to prevent attacks.
